# RBAC Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

Your PUSD SPL token program now has a complete **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system with three roles:

### 1. **Admin Role**
- Can add new users with any role (Admin, Authorized Contract, Operator)
- Can remove users and their roles
- Full control over role management

### 2. **Authorized Contract Role** 
- Can call the `mint()` function
- Designed for smart contracts that need minting capabilities
- Takes recipient address and amount as parameters

### 3. **Operator Role**
- Can call the `mint_by_operator()` function
- Designed for trusted individuals or automated systems
- Takes recipient address and amount as parameters

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Data Structures

**UserRole Account (PDA)**
```rust
pub struct UserRole {
    pub user: Pubkey,      // The user's public key
    pub role: Role,        // Their assigned role
    pub bump: u8,          // PDA bump seed
}
```

**Role Enum**
```rust
pub enum Role {
    Admin,
    AuthorizedContract,
    Operator,
}
```

### New Functions

1. **`initialize(initial_admin: Pubkey)`**
   - Sets up the first admin
   - Must be called once after deployment

2. **`add_role(user: Pubkey, role: Role)`** 
   - Admin only
   - Adds or updates a user's role

3. **`remove_role()`**
   - Admin only
   - Removes a user's role and closes the account

4. **`mint(amount: u64)`**
   - Authorized Contract only
   - Mints tokens to recipient

5. **`mint_by_operator(amount: u64)`**
   - Operator only
   - Mints tokens to recipient

### Access Control Mechanism

Each role is stored in a PDA with seeds: `["user_role", user_pubkey]`

Before executing privileged functions, the program:
1. Fetches the user's role account
2. Verifies the role matches the required permission
3. Returns `Unauthorized` error if role doesn't match

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Modified
- `programs/pusd-spl/src/lib.rs` - Added RBAC logic
- `programs/pusd-spl/Cargo.toml` - Added `init-if-needed` feature

### Created
- `RBAC_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide
- `tests/rbac-tests.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `scripts/initialize-rbac.ts` - Initialize with first admin
- `scripts/manage-roles.ts` - CLI tool to manage roles

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Build and Deploy
```bash
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

### Step 2: Initialize with Admin
```bash
ts-node scripts/initialize-rbac.ts
```

### Step 3: Add Roles
```bash
# Add an operator
ts-node scripts/manage-roles.ts add <OPERATOR_PUBKEY> operator

# Add an authorized contract
ts-node scripts/manage-roles.ts add <CONTRACT_PUBKEY> contract
```

### Step 4: Use the Functions

**As Admin:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .addRole(newUserPubkey, { operator: {} })
  .accounts({ ... })
  .rpc();
```

**As Authorized Contract:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .mint(new BN(1_000_000))
  .accounts({ ... })
  .rpc();
```

**As Operator:**
```typescript
await program.methods
  .mintByOperator(new BN(1_000_000))
  .accounts({ ... })
  .rpc();
```

## üîê Security Features

1. **Role Verification**: Every privileged function checks the caller's role
2. **PDA-based Storage**: Roles are stored in PDAs controlled by the program
3. **One Role Per User**: Each user can only hold one role at a time
4. **Admin-only Management**: Only admins can add/remove roles
5. **Account Closure**: Removed roles close their accounts, refunding rent

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First Admin Setup**: The `initialize` function must be called first to set up the admin
2. **Mint Authority**: Don't forget to transfer mint authority to the PDA using `transfer_mint_authority_to_pda`
3. **Testing**: Run tests on devnet before deploying to mainnet
4. **Admin Security**: Protect the admin wallet - consider using a multisig

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
anchor test
```

Or specifically test RBAC:
```bash
anchor test --tests rbac-tests
```

## üìö Additional Resources

- See `RBAC_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage examples
- Check `tests/rbac-tests.ts` for code examples
- Use `scripts/manage-roles.ts` for easy role management

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Build the program**: `anchor build`
2. **Deploy to devnet**: `anchor deploy`
3. **Initialize**: Run the initialization script
4. **Add roles**: Use the management script
5. **Test thoroughly**: Run tests before mainnet
6. **Security audit**: Consider professional audit for mainnet
7. **Monitor**: Track all minting operations
8. **Upgrade to multisig**: Use Squads for admin control

## ‚ùì Regarding Your Original Question

**Can you upgrade the program with multisig?**

Yes! You have two options:

1. **Program Upgrade Authority**: Use a multisig (like Squads) as the program's upgrade authority to control deployments
   ```bash
   solana program set-upgrade-authority <PROGRAM_ID> --new-upgrade-authority <MULTISIG_ADDRESS>
   ```

2. **Admin Role Multisig**: Set the admin role to a multisig address, requiring multiple signatures for role management

Both can be used together for maximum security!
